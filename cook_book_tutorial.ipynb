    "A detailed guide on how to create a JupyterBook, configure it, and host it on GitHub Pages. It includes all the necessary steps, scripts, and configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Install Jupyter Book**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to install Jupyter Book using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Create a New JupyterBook**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new JupyterBook, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter-book create mynewbook/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will create a directory called `mynewbook/` with a basic structure for your JupyterBook. The structure will include the following key files and directories:\n",
    "- `mynewbook/_config.yml`: The configuration file for your book.\n",
    "- `mynewbook/_toc.yml`: The table of contents file for your book.\n",
    "- `mynewbook/intro.md`: An introductory markdown file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Add Content to Your JupyterBook**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add content to your JupyterBook by creating markdown (`.md`) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files in the `mynewbook/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, create a new markdown file `chapter1.md`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Chapter 1: Introduction to JupyterBook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your first chapter.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Configure `_config.yml`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_config.yml` file is where you set the configuration options for your JupyterBook. Below is an example configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Book title\n",
    "title: \"My JupyterBook\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Author's name\n",
    "author: \"Haile\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Book language\n",
    "language: \"en\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logo\n",
    "logo: \"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Links in the footer of your book\n",
    "extra_footer:\n",
    "  - \"Created by Haile\"\n",
    "  - \"Hosted on GitHub Pages\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# HTML options\n",
    "html:\n",
    "  favicon: \"path/to/favicon.ico\"\n",
    "  use_repository_button: true\n",
    "  repository_url: \"https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository\"\n",
    "  repository_branch: \"main\"\n",
    "  use_edit_page_button: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Configure `_toc.yml`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_toc.yml` file is where you define the table of contents for your book. Below is an example configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "format: jb-book\n",
    "root: intro\n",
    "\n",
    "chapters:\n",
    "  - file: chapter1\n",
    "  - file: chapter2\n",
    "    sections:\n",
    "      - file: section1\n",
    "      - file: section2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `root` specifies the entry point of the book (e.g., `intro.md`).\n",
    "- `chapters` lists the main chapters and any subsections of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Build the JupyterBook**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've added your content and configured your files, build the JupyterBook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd mynewbook/\n",
    "jupyter-book build .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will generate static HTML files in the `_build/html/` directory. You can preview your book by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Host on GitHub Pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "To host your JupyterBook on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1 **Initialize a GitHub Repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.\n",
    "2. Clone the repository to your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git\n",
    "   cd your-repository-name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Copy the contents of the `_build/html/` directory to your repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cp -r ../mynewbook/_build/html/* .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2 **Install `ghp-import`**\n",
    "\n",
    "To easily deploy your book to GitHub Pages, install the `ghp-import` tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install ghp-import\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.3 **Publish the Book**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `ghp-import` to publish the book to the `gh-pages` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html\n",
    "```\n",
    "- -n : Prevents GitHub Pages from using Jekyll, which could interfere with your book's structure.\n",
    "- -f : Forces the overwrite of the existing content in the gh-pages branch.\n",
    "- -p : Automatically pushes the changes to GitHub, making your book live immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command pushes your book's HTML files to a branch called `gh-pages` on GitHub. GitHub Pages will automatically detect this branch and host your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Configure GitHub Pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the settings of your GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section.\n",
    "3. Set the source to `gh-pages` branch.\n",
    "4. Save the changes, and your JupyterBook should be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You've successfully created a JupyterBook, configured it, and hosted it on GitHub Pages. You can now share the link to your book with others, and they can view it online."
